## Data Collection
I use Counter.dev, a minimalist analytics tool, to gather anonymous insights about website usage, including:
- Visit and page view counts
- Device type (computer, mobile, tablet)
- Browser information
- Broad geographic origin
- Pages accessed

This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally.

## Purpose of Data Collection
The collected information helps me to:
- Understand how visitors interact with my portfolio
- Improve website design and user experience
- Ensure technical performance and reliability
- Generate anonymous usage insights

## Legal Basis
Data collection is based on legitimate professional interest in understanding and enhancing my website's performance (in line with GDPR Article 6.1.f). These anonymous audience measurements comply with EU ePrivacy regulations and CNIL recommendations.

## Data Management
The data is processed exclusively by Counter.dev, the analytics provider. No personal information is collected or shared with third parties.

## Data Privacy
Since all collected data is strictly anonymous, it cannot be used to identify individual users. Consequently, specific user data access or modification requests are not applicable.
