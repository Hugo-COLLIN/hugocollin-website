## Overview
The purpose of the project was to develop a web application to learn vocabulary. But the main feature 
here was the use of speech synthesis to pronounce words, allowing users to hear the correct pronunciation of words.

The app had to allow you to select lists of words, listen to their pronunciation, and play an interactive game
to test your knowledge.
The goal is to make vocabulary learning more fun and effective by combining visual and auditory elements.

## Features developed
- Choose from several sets of vocabulary.
- Listen to the pronunciation of the word corresponding to the image.
- Play a game with the chosen vocabulary series.
- Listen to the pronunciation of the word by clicking on the "Listen" button.
- Display a message and score at the end of the game.
- Display a visual signal (changing the color of the boxes) and launch an audio message when interacting with the game grid.
- Wait 2 seconds at the end of the game before displaying the game result page.

## Challenges Faced
Developing LeonApp presented several challenges, including:
- Thinking about page succession, game logic, and UX in general to make an intuitive interface.
- Developing a maintainable code in the long term in a very short time.
- Implementing a reliable system for playing audio pronunciations without delays.
- Implementing the game system and the logic behind it.

## Skills Acquired

| Skills                       | Details                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web Development              | The project deepened our expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as we used Javascript OOP and we developped a small hand-made single-page framework. |
| Audio Processing             | We learned how to efficiently handle audio files to ensure smooth playback of pronunciations.                                                         |
| User Interface Design        | Designing an engaging and intuitive interface was crucial, enhancing our UI/UX design skills.                                                         |
| Project Management           | We had to meet the challenge of developing a maintainable code in the long term in a very short time.                                                 |


## Conclusion
The development of LeonApp was a fun and interesting experience that allowed us to deepen our knowledge of web development and audio processing.
