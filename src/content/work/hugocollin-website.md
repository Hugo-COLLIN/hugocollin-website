## Overview
The website you are currently visiting is my personal website. 
It is a place where I can showcase my work and share my learnings and thoughts.
It is also a way for me to learn new technologies and experiment with new ideas.

I uploaded a first version of my website in my first year IT studies, using only HTML and CSS. 
I was not satisfied with the result, so I decided to start over from scratch and use a static website generator.
I finally found a solution that suited me: the Astro framework. 
It is a simple but modular static website generator that attracted me as soon as I discovered it.

I also decided to use Vercel to host my website, as I had heard good things about it and it was free.
I combined it with my custom domain name from OVH, which I already had.

## Challenges Faced
- Learn how to use Astro and Vercel.
- Compile all the information I wanted to share in a clear and concise way.

## Conclusion

I learned a new way to build static websites with Astro and to host them with Vercel.

I am very satisfied with the result and I hope you will enjoy it too.
