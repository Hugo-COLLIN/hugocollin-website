## Overview
The Phind chatbot is a new search engine using AI to find information and solve problems. 
But, while it's a really powerful tool, there's no native options to save or download your threads locally. 
As an Obsidian.md user, I wanted to process the information provided by Phind into my knowledge base.

That's why I develop the Save my Phind extension. 
When you're on a Phind thread, simply click on the extension icon to extract it's content into a formatted markdown file.

The last updates empowers the Phind interface by adding a saving button directly inside the page. 
Plus, you can now export all the threads in your list by clicking on the "Export All Threads" button.
Finally, I also added a filter bar to help you to look inside your recent threads.


## Goal
The primary goal behind "Save My Phind" was to provide users with the ability to keep AI-generated information offline, to enable them to share threads with others, and read and process them in a note-taking app like Obsidian.
Now, it also enhances the usability of Phind by modifying directly its interface.


## Challenges Faced
While developing Save My Phind, I faced several challenges, including:
1. Learning how to build a Chrome extension from scratch.
2. Understanding the Turndown library for converting HTML to markdown.
3. Dividing my code into modules for better organization and maintainability.
4. Automating the app building process for both Chrome and Firefox using NPM.

## Skills Developed
During the development of Save My Phind, I possessed and acquired the following skills:
