## Overview
Hug Journal was my childhood blog, which I created, managed, and maintained from primary school to high school. Although it is no longer active, it holds an important place as it was my first venture into the world of blogging.

## Goal
The main goal of Hug Journal was to share my passions and interests with others. Every month (later every two months due to school priorities), I would publish a post containing various articles about my favorite movies, games, experiences, and even a humor section to lighten the mood.

## Challenges Faced
Balancing my blog with schoolwork was a significant challenge, as I had to prioritize my studies. Additionally, coming up with fresh and engaging content on a regular basis required creativity and dedication.
