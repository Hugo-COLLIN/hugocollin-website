## Overview
The Plic Compiler is a Java compiler for the Plic language, a simple language created for educational purposes.


## Goal
The primary goal behind the building of this compiler was to learn:
- how an assembly language works;
- how a compiler works and how to build one for a simple language;
- how to generate MIPS assembly code from a high-level language;
- how to analyze and optimize code.

## Features developed
- Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis
- Semantic analysis
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- Code generation

## Challenges Faced
The main difficulty here was to understand how assembly and compiling works and how to build a compiler,
all within a tight timeframe. Each week was really intense, with a new part of the compiler to build and to test.


## Skills Acquired

| Skills                            | Details                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compiler Development              | I learned how to build a compiler for a simple language.                                                                                         |
| High to Low-Level Code Generation | I learned how to generate assembly code from a high-level language.                                                                              |
| Problem-solving                   | I faced numerous challenges during the development process and had to find effective solutions for them.                                         |
| Batch Testing / ApprovalTests     | I learned how to test my compiler with a lot of test cases. Plus, I took the opportunity to integrate ApprovalTests to batch test PLIC programs. |
| Generate Jar file                 | I learned how to generate a Jar file to distribute my compiler.                                                                                  |

## Conclusion
Building the Plic Compiler was a challenging but rewarding experience. 
I learned a lot about how programming languages are working and built.
Even if it's not perfect because of shortened delays, I'm satisfied of the final result and the knowledge I acquired.
